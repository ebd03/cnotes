</p><ol>

<li>
<b>Redirection:</b><p>

One way to get input into a program or to display output from a program
is to use <em>standard input</em> and <em>standard output</em>,
respectively.  All that means is that to read in data, we use
<code>scanf()</code> (or a few other functions) and to write out data,
we use <code>printf()</code>.

</p><p>
When we need to take input from a file (instead of having the user type
data at the keyboard) we can use input redirection:

</p><blockquote><pre>% <b>a.out &lt; inputfile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This allows us to use the same <code>scanf()</code> calls we use to
read from the keyboard.  With input redirection, the operating system
causes input to come from the file (e.g., <code>inputfile</code> above)
instead of the keyboard.

</p><p>
Similarly, there is <em>output redirection</em>:

</p><blockquote><pre>% <b>a.out &gt; outputfile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
that allows us to use <code>printf()</code> as before, but that causes
the output of the program to go to a file (e.g., <code>outputfile</code>
above) instead of the screen.

</p><p>
Of course, the 2 types of redirection can be used at the same time...

</p><blockquote><pre>% <b>a.out &lt; inputfile &gt; outputfile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>C File I/O:</b><p>

While redirection is very useful, it is really part of the operating
system (not C).  In fact, C has a general mechanism for reading and
writing files, which is more flexible than redirection alone.

</p><h3>stdio.h</h3>

There are types and functions in the library <b>stdio.h</b> that are
used for file I/O.  Make sure you always include that header when you
use files.

<h4>Type</h4>

For files you want to read or write, you need a file pointer, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>FILE *fp;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
What is this type "<code>FILE *</code>"?  Realistically, you don't need
to know.  Just think of it as some abstract data structure, whose
details are hidden from you.  In other words, the only way you can use
a <code>FILE *</code> is via the functions that C gives you.

</p><p>
</p><hr align="left" width="20%">
<b>Note:</b>
In reality, <code>FILE</code> is some kind of structure that holds
information about the file.  We must use a <code>FILE *</code> because
certain functions will need to change that information, i.e., we need
to pass the information around <em>by reference</em>.
<hr align="left" width="20%">

<h4>Functions</h4>

Reading from or writing to a file in C requires 3 basic steps:

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the file.
</li><li>Do all the reading or writing.
</li><li>Close the file.
</li></ol>

<p>
Following are described the functions needed to accomplish each step.

</p><p>
A complete program that includes the example described below, plus an
input file to use with that program, is available to <a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/file-io/intro/download/">download</a>.

</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Opening a file:</b><p>

In order to open a file, use the function <code>fopen()</code>.
Use it as:

</p><blockquote><pre>fp = fopen(<em>filename</em>, <em>mode</em>);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>filename</em> is a string that holds the name of the file on disk
(including a <em>path</em> like <code>/cs/course</code> if necessary).

<p>
</p></li><li><em>mode</em> is a string representing how you want to open the
file.  Most often you'll open a file for reading (<code>"r"</code>) or
writing (<code>"w"</code>).
</li></ul>

<p>
Note that <code>fopen()</code> returns a <code>FILE *</code> that can
then be used to access the file.  When the file cannot be opened (e.g.,
we don't have permission or it doesn't exist when opening for reading),
<code>fopen()</code> will return <code>NULL</code>.

</p><p>
Here are examples of opening files:

<a name="fileio1"></a>
</p><blockquote><pre>FILE *ifp, *ofp;
char *mode = "r";
char outputFilename[] = "out.list";

ifp = fopen("in.list", mode);

if (ifp == NULL) {
  fprintf(stderr, "Can't open input file in.list!\n");
  exit(1);
}

ofp = fopen(outputFilename, "w");

if (ofp == NULL) {
  fprintf(stderr, "Can't open output file %s!\n",
          outputFilename);
  exit(1);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that the input file that we are opening for reading
(<code>"r"</code>) must already exist.  In contrast, the output file we
are opening for writing (<code>"w"</code>) does not have to exist.  If
it doesn't, it will be created.  If this output file does already
exist, its previous contents will be thrown away (and will be lost).

</p><p>
</p><hr align="left" width="20%">
<b>Note:</b>
There are other modes you can use when opening a file, such as append
(<code>"a"</code>) to append something to the end of a file without
losing its contents...or modes that allow you to both read and write.
You can look up these other modes in a good C reference on
<code>stdio.h</code>.
<hr align="left" width="20%">

<p>
</p></li><li><b>Reading from or writing to a file:</b><p>

Once a file has been successfully opened, you can read from it using
<code>fscanf()</code> or write to it using <code>fprintf()</code>.  These
functions work just like <code>scanf()</code> and <code>printf()</code>,
except they require an extra first parameter, a <code>FILE *</code> for
the file to be read/written.

</p><p>
</p><hr align="left" width="20%">
<b>Note:</b>
There are other functions in <b>stdio.h</b> that can be used to read or
write files.  Look them up in a good C reference.
<hr align="left" width="20%">

<p>
Continuing our example from above, suppose the input file consists of
lines with a <em>username</em> and an <em>integer test score</em>, e.g.:

</p><blockquote><pre>in.list
------
foo 70
bar 98
...
</pre></blockquote>

and that each username is no more than 8 characters long.

<p>
We might use the files we opened <a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/file-io/intro/#fileio1">above</a> by
copying each username and score from the input file to the output
file.  In the process, we'll increase each score by <nobr>10
points</nobr> for the output file:

</p><blockquote><pre>char username[9];  /* One extra for nul char. */
int score;

<b>...</b>

while (fscanf(ifp, "%s %d", username, &amp;score) != EOF) {
  fprintf(ofp, "%s %d\n", username, score+10);
}

<b>...</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The function <code>fscanf()</code>, like <code>scanf()</code>, normally
returns the number of values it was able to read in.  However, when it
hits the end of the file, it returns the special value <code>EOF</code>.
So, testing the return value against <code>EOF</code> is one way to stop
the loop.

</p><p>
The bad thing about testing against <code>EOF</code> is that if the
file is not in the right format (e.g., a letter is found when a number
is expected):

</p><blockquote><pre>in.list
------
foo 70
bar 98
biz A+
...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
then <code>fscanf()</code> will not be able to read that line (since
there is no integer to read) and it won't advance to the next line in
the file.  For this error, <code>fscanf()</code> will not return
<code>EOF</code> (it's not at the end of the file)....

</p><p>
Errors like that will at least mess up how the rest of the file is
read.  In some cases, they will cause an <em>infinite loop</em>.

</p><p>
One solution is to test against the number of values we expect to be
read by <code>fscanf()</code> each time.  Since our format is
<nobr><code>"%s %d"</code></nobr>, we expect it to read in 2 values,
so our condition could be:

</p><blockquote><pre>while (fscanf(ifp, "%s %d", username, &amp;score) <font color="#ee0000">== 2</font>) {
  <b>...</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, if we get 2 values, the loop continues.  If we don't get 2 values,
either because we are at the end of the file or some other problem
occurred (e.g., it sees a letter when it is trying to read in a number
with <code>%d</code>), then the loop will end.

</p><p>
Another way to test for end of file is with the library function
<code>feof()</code>.  It just takes a file pointer and returns a
true/false value based on whether we are at the end of the file.

</p><p>
To use it in the above example, you would do:

</p><blockquote><pre>while (<font color="#ee0000">!feof(ifp)</font>) {
  if (fscanf(ifp, "%s %d", username, &amp;score) <font color="#ee0000">!= 2</font>)
    break;
  fprintf(ofp, "%s %d", username, score+10);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that, like testing <code>!= EOF</code>, it might cause an infinite
loop if the format of the input file was not as expected.  However, we
can add code to make sure it reads in 2 values (as we've done above).

</p><p>
</p><hr align="left" width="20%">
<b>Note:</b>
When you use <code>fscanf(...) != EOF</code> or <code>feof(...)</code>,
they will not detect the end of the file until they try to read past
it.  In other words, they won't report end-of-file on the last valid
read, only on the one after it.
<hr align="left" width="20%">

<p>
</p></li><li><b>Closing a file:</b><p>

When done with a file, it must be closed using the function
<code>fclose()</code>.

</p><p>
To finish our example, we'd want to close our input and output files:

</p><blockquote><pre>fclose(ifp);
fclose(ofp);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Closing a file is very important, especially with output files.  The
reason is that output is often <em>buffered</em>.  This means that when
you tell C to write something out, e.g.,

</p><blockquote><pre>fprintf(ofp, "Whatever!\n");
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
it doesn't necessary get written to disk right away, but may end up in
a <em>buffer</em> in memory.  This output buffer would hold the text
temporarily:

</p><blockquote><pre>Sample output buffer:
----------------------------------------------
| a | b  | c <font color="#ee0000">| W | h | a | t | e | v | e | r |</font>
----------------------------------------------
<font color="#ee0000">| ! | \n |</font>   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
----------------------------------------------
|   |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
----------------------------------------------
|   |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
----------------------------------------------
<b>...</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(The buffer is really just 1-dimensional despite this drawing.)

</p><p>
When the buffer fills up (or when the file is <em>closed</em>), the
data is finally written to disk.

</p><p>
So, if you forget to close an output file then whatever is still
in the buffer may not be written out.

</p><p>
</p><hr align="left" width="20%">
<b>Note:</b>
There are other kinds of buffering than the one we describe here.
<hr align="left" width="20%">

<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>Special file pointers:</b><p>

There are 3 special <code>FILE *</code>'s that are always defined for
a program.  They are <code>stdin</code> (<em>standard input</em>),
<code>stdout</code> (<em>standard output</em>) and <code>stderr</code>
(<em>standard error</em>).

</p><h3>Standard Input</h3>

<p>
<em>Standard input</em> is where things come from when you use
<code>scanf()</code>.  In other words,

</p><blockquote><pre>scanf("%d", &amp;val);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
is equivalent to the following <code>fscanf()</code>:

</p><blockquote><pre>fscanf(stdin, "%d", &amp;val);
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Standard Output</h3>

<p>
Similarly, <em>standard output</em> is exactly where things go when you
use <code>printf()</code>.  In other words,

</p><blockquote><pre>printf("Value = %d\n", val):
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
is equivalent to the following <code>fprintf()</code>:

</p><blockquote><pre>fprintf(stdout, "Value = %d\n", val):
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Remember that standard input is normally associated with the keyboard
and standard output with the screen, unless <em>redirection</em> is
used.

</p><h3>Standard Error</h3>

<em>Standard error</em> is where you should display error messages.
We've already done that above:

<blockquote><pre>fprintf(stderr, "Can't open input file in.list!\n");
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Standard error is normally associated with the same place as standard
output; however, redirecting standard output does not redirect standard
error.

</p><p>
For example,

</p><blockquote><pre>% <b>a.out &gt; outfile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
only redirects stuff going to standard output to the file <b>outfile</b>...
anything written to standard error goes to the screen.

</p><p>
</p><h3>Using the Special File Pointers</h3>

We've already seen that <em>stderr</em> is useful for printing error
messages, but you may be asking, "When would I ever use the special file
pointers <em>stdin</em> and <em>stdout</em>?"  Well, suppose you create
a function that writes a bunch of data to an opened file that is specified
as a parameter:

<blockquote><pre>void WriteData(FILE *fp)
{
  fprintf(fp, "data1\n");
  fprintf(fp, "data2\n");
  ...
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Certainly, you can use it to write the data to an output file (like
the one above):

</p><blockquote><pre>WriteData(ofp);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
But, you can also write the data to standard output:

</p><blockquote><pre>WriteData(stdout);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Without the special file pointer <em>stdout</em>, you'd have to write a
second version of <code>WriteData()</code> that wrote stuff to standard
output.
